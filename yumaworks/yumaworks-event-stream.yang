         "Event stream configuration information.
          This configuration is used in addition to the
          --event-stream and --event-stream-map CLI parameters.

          If notifications are disabled because --with-notifications
          is set to 'false' then configuration of this subtree will
          have no affect.

          Event Stream Usage:

          - Event types are assigned to event streams based on the module
            that contains the notification definition for the event.
          - All events in the module have to be assigned to the same
            event stream.
          - A module can be assigned to only one event-stream at a time.
          - If a module is not assigned to an event stream then the
            'NETCONF' event stream will be used.
          - If the module instrumentation sends the event to a specific
            event-stream then that event-stream is used, or the
            'NETCONF' stream is used if the stream name is invalid.
          - If the module instrumentation does not specify an
            event stream when the event is generated, then the
            module-map list and CLI configured event-stream-map
            parameters will be checked for a mapping. If none,
            or the event stream name is invalid, then the 'NETCONF'
            event stream will be used.";
